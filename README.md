# ElastAlert Server Helm Chart

ElastAlert and ElastAlert Server component for Praeco.

Please refer to the [Praeco Helm Chart](https://github.com/daichi703n/praeco-helm).

## Compatibility
**This chart supports only ES7.**

If there are many requests, I'll consider to support ES6. I think that switching container tag enables to support other ES ver. (Container Image Tags are not implemented...)
